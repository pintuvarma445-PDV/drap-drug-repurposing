# DRAP – Drug Repurposing Analytics Platform

This project is a learning + showcase project where I combine my
pharmaceutical background (NIPER Kolkata) with my data analytics
training (Mu Sigma).

## Idea in simple words

I will build a small end-to-end pipeline that:
- Takes a set of molecules (SMILES)
- Converts them into molecular descriptors (features)
- Trains a simple QSAR model to predict activity
- (Later) can be extended with docking scores and dashboards

## Tech stack (Phase 1)

- Python
- RDKit
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks
